The plan for the workshop is, we will cover what is a unit test how to bring them into Angular, then we will see what is the Angular TestBed and how never forget the how to write a test in Angular. Also, we will see how to test providers and components and We will meet the "Do-it-yourself Angular Test framework to facilitate your development life. Next, we will introduce TDD and we can deep into Karma Jasmine and Protractor to definitely you be on the road. A little bit of sugar with e2e tests and finally We will introduce the Angular TestBed (ATB) repository and We will see how to contribute using unit tests to the Angular / Angular TestBed projects.',

Once we launch this application on our phone, it will start sending device motion data from our phone to the browser, using the brand new device event APIs to capture our device’s acceleration, orientation and motion, and our node.js server to perform the transmission. The browser will receive the motion data, and it will translate it into events and actions on the big screen! Tools that are going to be used are the WebSockets API, Angular, RxJS and a little Node.js server. Observable sequences will help us subscribe and listen to incoming messages, firing events in the process.
